"The test of nature is its ability to remain," as when we are brought to our senses by heaped fruit and vegetables, our eyes breaking on the jetties of oranges.
And then I was starting to propose something about Nana, or perhaps I was anticipating another separation, your crossing, leaving to look into a store window.
But there is always more of it going on. always more experience towing us forward, leaving that part to be worked out inwardly as we look into a store window.
I should have more properly referred to the moment of Emma's death. Without rapport even then, the death deaf to opportunity or calling, listlessly wandering off.
Cowardice? I think that that scene prefigured indifference elsewhere. The moment as it is is too lofty. Everyone is here and yet not here, their faces have departed for who knows where—
blank as the street, the long span
of the table. Taking up where they leave off, may one say then
disregard is used to crop relationship?
The heart pours itself into order and attaches to objects. The senses are borne with great clarity in bins picked from the orchards.
"The test of nature is its ability to remain," in the sense that nature has to remind of its use,
"the taut cord and the elasticity of wood,"
so that we implement these leading materials.
But it is an evident strain to bring something into existence.
I was never so aware of the form of taking a walk as when it was a dexterity disowned by you.
Perhaps you understood my remarks as an inducement "to have an experience," an invented intimacy culture often tries for, and so you pretended to be inept-which in its extreme is also a form and a diversion. Yet I believe you, this unstringing of yours,
instinctively protecting yourself from my reach.
